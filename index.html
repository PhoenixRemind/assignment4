                <h1>I, Paul: The Memoirs of a Nerd</h1>
                <p>Today we take a brief adventure in the realm of hobbies involving one Paul Deyarmin. We will <em>unfortunately</em> discover some of my passions as well as some interesting stories I have to share from said hobbies. They will range from reading and writing, painting, gaming and even metal detecting adventures with my treasure hunting pirate comrade.</p>

                    <h2>Reading/Writing and D&D:</h2>
                    <p>I have always had a passion for reading that started at a young age with classic literature mostly due to my Mother. Treasure Island has to be the first book I can recall adoring as a child and then followed other literary works written by Dickens, Austen, Twain, Carroll and many more. My taste in reading evolved over the years and I completely fell in love with fantasy adventures such as anything Forgotten Realms based, especially by R.A. Salvatore and other works such as The Dragonlance Chronicles and Sword of Truth series. My love for fantasy, adventure, wizards and obviously dragons led me on a path to try out Dungeons and Dragons. D&D sparked my desire to write and create content so that I can share these adventures and characters I've created with those who take these storytelling journies with me. To this day I cannot think of a better way to spend time with friends than letting your collective imaginations run wild and telling stories together.</p>

                    <h2>Painting:</h2>
                    <p>This hobby now ties together with my D&D shenanigans mostly due in part to painting miniatures I use to represent characters or creatures through my campaigns. It has also evolved into painting other creatures I have made from oddities such as PVC piping, soda bottles and other random trinkets. I started painting when I was playing Warhammer fantasy, a tabletop strategy game that involves miniature armies in rank and file as well as measuring tape and lots of dice. I can tell you I was pretty awful at painting and I chose an army that was comprised of tiny rat men that normally consisted of several hundred separate models for an army composition. Painting hundreds of rat men was a trial in and of itself, but it definitely grew my skills. I have always been atrocious at drawing and even painting on an easel, but I have a knack for making little pieces of metal and plastic look decent with paint. I am at my most zen when I am deep into a painting project, with either movies or music on in the background and just completely engrossed in trying to breathe life into that figure.</p>

                    <h2>Gaming:</h2>
                    <p>I could talk at extreme length on my gaming hobbies. They obviously range from tabletop games such as Settlers of Cataan, Secret Hitler, Magic The gathering to puzzles and critical thinking games and then onward to video games. Strategy games and RTS video games tend to be my favorites when it comes to the wheelhouse I play in. I mostly try to utilize games nowadays to keep friendships intact. As we have all grown older and moved in directions or even places that don't make it convenient to meet on a regular basis, games have made it very convenient to pass the time with friends thousands of miles away or just busy with day to day life. I find it fascinating how gaming and what it means to me has evolved throughout the years, having started as just a kid playing games as that's what many kids do, to going into competitive gaming and winning money, trophies and other prizes to finally ending up with using it as a social mechanism to keep friendships intact.</p>

                    <h2 class="ontop">Outdoors Shenanigans:</h2>
                    <p class="ontop">I get it. Enough with the indoor basement nerd activities. So let's talk about some outdoors fun as well as a new hobby I was introduced to by a friend of mine whom is engrossed in this hobby. I do love getting in touch with nature, especially the woods or the mountains/hills types of areas. I was forced to hunt at an early age and never really took a liking to killing animals, but at least grew an affinity for the outdoors because of my time spent with nature. I have long since put down the rifle and bow but have recently picked up a new device to take with me on my outdoors adventures and that is a metal detector. My friend has brought this aspect into my life and I absolutely love the idea of rescuing history that's been buried and forgotten. My first adventure out with him was to a farm field that we had permission to detect on from the local farmer who's family owned that land for generations. He showed me the ropes on what to listen for and what numbers to keep an eye out, knowing you potentially found something worth digging up. Target after target, beep after beep, my first outing was producing many pieces of coal...to which he jokingly told me "Santa really loves you today buddy". 30 minutes later and about 9 total holes dug out (and filled back in because we do not want to leave the land in any worse shape than we found it, always fill your holes) I came across a piece of silver sticking out of a hole I dug. It almost looked like a coin, but as I excavated it, what I held in my hand was a silver thimble with fancy engraving. That started the treasure bug and has given me a drive to venture forth with my brother in arms to go rescue more history that's been swallowed up by the land. I believe my inner pirate awoke that day and just wants to find all the precious metals I can. Yar har matey!</p>
