        <h1>I, Paul: The Memoirs of a Nerd</h1>
        <p>Today we take a brief adventure in the realm of hobbies involving one Paul Deyarmin. We will <em>unfortunately</em> discover some of my passions as well as some interesting stories I have to share from said hobbies. They will range from reading and writing, painting, gaming and even metal detecting adventures with my treasure hunting pirate comrade.</p>

                <h2>Reading/Writing and D&D:</h2>
                <p>I have always had a passion for reading that started at a young age with classic literature mostly due to my Mother. Treasure Island has to be the first book I can recall adoring as a child and then followed other literary works written by Dickens, Austen, Twain, Carroll and many more. My taste in reading evolved over the years and I completely fell in love with fantasy adventures such as anything Forgotten Realms based, especially by R.A. Salvatore and other works such as The Dragonlance Chronicles and Sword of Truth series. My love for fantasy, adventure and obviously dragons led me on a path to try out Dungeons and Dragons. D&D opened up my desire to write and create content so that I can share these adventures and characters I've created with those closest to me. To this day I cannot think of a better way to spend time with friends than letting your collective imaginations run wild and telling stories together.</p>
